# Aider Checklist Usage Instructions

1. Reference Files:
   - Master Checklist: Master-sms-optimization-checklist.md
   - Working Checklist: Working_Project_Checklist.md

2. Checklist Update Process:
   - Only modify the Working_Project_Checklist.md, never the master file.
   - Use SEARCH/REPLACE to update task status: [ ] to [x] for completed tasks.
   - Example: SEARCH "[ ] Project Setup and Basic Bonzo API Integration" REPLACE "[x] Project Setup and Basic Bonzo API Integration"

3. Progress Tracking:
   - Before starting new tasks, compare Working_Project_Checklist.md against Master-sms-optimization-checklist.md.
   - Identify completed tasks and determine next steps based on unchecked items.

4. Component Completion Criteria:
   - A component is complete when its associated files are implemented and its success criteria are met.
   - Verify success criteria listed for each component before marking as complete.

5. Dependency Management:
   - Ensure prerequisites are completed before starting dependent tasks.
   - Example: Complete "Project Setup and Basic Bonzo API Integration" before "Simple Dashboard Component".

6. Incremental Development:
   - Focus on one component at a time to maintain context and ensure thorough implementation.
   - Update the working checklist after completing each significant subtask within a component.

7. Reporting:
   - Provide a summary of completed tasks and next steps at the end of each development session.
   - Include any challenges encountered and proposed solutions.

Remember: This checklist is a tool to guide development. Use it flexibly and update it as needed to reflect the project's evolving requirements and progress.
